# HTML and CSS


##What I learned

Spans in HTML are like mini divs they are the only kind of container tag that can be used within a paragraph. These can be used for sub selecting a text or addind a visual element to a text element.

Two types of psuedo elements in HTML. Double semicolon::
A before element, and an after element and you can only have two on one singular element. BUT you pick them based on whether or not the special element that you are going to add is underneath or on top of or before or after the contents.

Position: The default placement of an element on a webpage, specifying how it is positioned relative to other elements or the vieport, using properties like "top,"left," "right," and "bottom" to define its exact location; essentially, it controls where an element appears on the screen and how it interacts with scrolling behavior.

Margin: Determines the spacing on the outside of a container

Justification: is the alignment is where they if it's a row on the cross axis and the and the justification is where they sit across that row and so space between means it's going to push the children contents to either side of the row.
